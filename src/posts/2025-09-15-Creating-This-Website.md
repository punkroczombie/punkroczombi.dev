So today as of 9/15/2025 I created this website using ribo.zone's Cyanobacteria Template. I setup my DNS using Cloudflare (although I had to disable proxying since cloudflare didnt play nice with tracking). I also ended up paying for a supporter supscription for neocities since I think its a pretty cool service that I really think more people should try using.

But enough of that, what did I learn? I learned that I am ***Rusty*** at HTML and CSS. I do not remember how to make a website since I learned it in grade school, but I think i'm getting the hang of it now. I will prob look into ways of making the naviagation and other elements a partials instead of having to update the nav bar and footer everywhere.

But another thing that I re-discovered was the fun it was to make a website and kinda just mess around with what css and htmlv4&5 has to offer (or rather in some cases a lack thereof)

Also going to try to start doing a weekly blog, so wish me luck with that lol. You'll see how successful that was if you find this at the bottom at a whole list of blogs lol.

Anyways, Signing Off. See you next week!
