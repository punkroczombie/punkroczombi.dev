So this weekend I decided I would take a leap and finally learn how to make a web app. While choosing which framework I went through a couple options.

**Frameworks:**
* ASP.NET
* Ruby on Rails
* Laravel
* Django

I ended up going with Ruby on Rails because I just couldn't really get into the other frameworks. I know that all the frameworks used the MVC flow, but the other frameworks either had confusing docs or a syntax. Plus I found alot of videos that helped me learn it pretty quickly.

I also used the devise, paranoia, and paper trail gems because I wanted to be able to revert deletions and track changes.

Had alot of fun learning and trying out a new tool.

Anyways, Signing Off. See you next week!
